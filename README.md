Team Name:
GetLaw

Proposed level of submission:
Apollo

Motivation:
Having heard the difficulty of attaining good lawyers without the need of going through a middleman/law firm, our team has decided to create a web application that would allow anyone to easily connect with the best lawyers in the industry without much of hassle. During development, we do hope to learn the in and outs of web development as well as processes that drive web applications. We do hope to improve our understanding of Object-oriented programming as well.
Once the web application is complete, it would allow for easy accessibility to any lawyer that would suit the client’s needs. 

Vision:
To create a website that would allow for clients seeking legal advice to connect with the most suitable lawyers at their desired price points, akin to Etsy but for lawyers. 
We do hope to make the Q&A process in our legal forum quick and engaging through in-built messaging platforms. Clients will be able to get legal advice from the best lawyers in the industry, anywhere and anytime. 

User Stories:
1.	As a potential divorcee who has questions and problems with the divorce procedure, I want to be able to ask questions and get quality answers quickly.
2.	As a business that requires advice during contract drafting, I want to get a lawyer that can help settle the legal fine print to make the process as smooth as possible 
3.	As a criminal who is about to be convicted for any crime, I want to be able to get a suitable lawyer who will be able to defend me.
4.	As a prospective homeowner, I would like to have somebody to settle the costs of acquiring my new property and guarantee the transfer process is smooth. (Conveyancing)
5.	As an inventor or patent holder, during instances of IP violation, I would like somebody to extract justice for me legally and hassle free.
6.	As a lawyer, I would like my services to be accessible at any time to those who need them the most. 

Features:
[Proposed]
An account system that would differentiate a user between a lawyer/client

 
Our proposed account system will be as such. Lawyers and normal clients will be differentiated through unique tokens. During account creation, lawyers will be required to submit specific documentation for verification purposes. All accounts will be required to register through SingPass to avoid fake or troll accounts as well as for verification purposes. 

[Current progress]

Currently, our proof of concept is being built using a Firebase to help construct a web login page. We do intend to integrate the system onto another platform before the Milestone 2 due to scalability reasons. We are in the midst of figuring out how to construct a proper registration page through the use of SingPass for verification purposes. 

[Proposed]
Forum for prospective clients to ask anonymous questions
We have proposed the creation of a forum using the confidence algorithm that Reddit uses. This will allow users to vote on anonymous questions and posts that they resonate with. Users will also vote for the best response by lawyers and the responses will be ranked according to the number of upvotes it has. 
We have also proposed the implementation of troll detection features that will flag and moderate posts that are inappropriate or harmful. We intend to use machine learning for this in order to identify such posts.
